description: Rejuvenation for the millions-or rejuvenation for the five hundred lucky
  ones, the select ones, that can be treated each year? Tough, independent Senator
  Dan Fowler fights a one-man battle against the clique that seeks perpetual power
  and perpetual youth, in this hard-hitting novel by Alan E. Nourse. Why did it have
  to be his personal fight? The others would fumble it-they'd foul it up, Fowler protested?
  But why was he in the fight and what was to happen to Senator Fowler's fight against
  this fantastic conspiracy? Who would win?
